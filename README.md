# coding_challenge
## Description

  You can navigate to the deployed site on Heroku <b>[here](https://polar-peak-92719.herokuapp.com/).</b>

  <p><i>Purpose of the application is to help users get a quote for their Travel Insurance.</i><p>

## Installation
Do the following in your Bash/Terminal:

* ```git clone git@github.com:mihaelavalac/coding_challenge.git```

* ```npm i```

* ```npm start```

* Navigate to http://localhost:3001/ to see the application running locally

Note: Node.js is a requirement for this project and any latest version is acceptable


## Testing Credentials

* Username: <b>welcome</b> 
* Password: <b>Mytest123!</b>

## Opportunities for Improvement
Creating the connection to the database using mysql would be a good step from here because it will save all the information about quotes. Moreover, right now there is a static auth process with predefined credentials, but having a process of registering users would be great.
